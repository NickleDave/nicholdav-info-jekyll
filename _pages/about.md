Hey, I'm David Nicholson.
Currently I am a machine intelligence engineer with Embedded Intelligence,
a start-up in the DC area, where I work on adversarial machine learning
and signal restoration.
Before moving to industry, I worked in academia
in the areas of cognition, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence.
During my post-doctoral fellowship at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia,
I worked with [Astrid Prinz](http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Prinz/index.html)
in the [Biology department](http://www.biology.emory.edu/),
on brain-inspired machine learning algorithms for continual learning,
as part of a [DARPA program](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2017-03-16).

I also work in applied machine learning, most recently in collaboration with Yarden Cohen ([twitter](https://twitter.com/YardenJCohen),
[github](https://github.com/yardencsGitHub/tweetynet)).
We are applying neural networks to segment and annotate the song of songbirds, which
in neuroscience serve as a model system to understand
how the brain learns and produces speech and similar motor skills, like
playing guitar or swinging a bat to hit a baseball.
In addition I maintain a software library,
[hybrid-vocal-classifier]((http://hybrid-vocal-classifier.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)),
 that automates annotation of birdsong for behavioral experiments.
These projects began during my graduate studies in [Sam Sober's lab](http://www.biology.emory.edu/research/Sober/Home.html).
My dissertation work in the Sober lab showed that connections which
are known to be important for learning motor skills in humans and other
mammals are also found in regions of the songbird brain
that are required to learn song.
